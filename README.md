# PS_Get-Temperature
*Get temperature with PowerShell*

Save in your c:\users\yourName\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\modules\ directory
in sub directory get-temperature as get-temperature.psm1
You **must** run as Administrator.
It will only work if your system & BIOS support it. If it doesn't work, I can't help you.
